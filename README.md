# Real-Time Immersive Exploration of Terrains in Extended Reality and Structure from Motion using Unmanned Aerial Vehicle by Simultaneous Localization and Mapping

•	In unknown terrain, the militant group with the local terrain knowledge have an edge over the rescue forces, which may cause damage to the military forces.
•	The satellite images of the terrain offer a 2-D top view of the terrain which provides path planning insights but fail to offer other information that provide a tactical advantage.
•	Usage of wheeled robots may not be effective in rough terrain and may take long time to explore, which would delay the operations.
•	UAV provides a low-risk solution for exploring the terrain.
•	Exploration of the terrain with images and video stream from UAV provides valuable insights.
•	The model of the terrain can provide a sophisticated arena for planning, post the UAV exploration.
•	Usage of Extended Reality to explore the terrain allows the military personnel to experience the ground-level reality.

Objectives:
1.	To design and implement a system capable of that the system can process data from UAV-mounted cameras to reconstruct the terrain in real-time.
2.	To develop an real-time incremental SfM method for high-frequency video and large baseline high-resolution sequential aerial images.
3.	To enable the UAV to localize in the terrain using Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) using robust algorithm.
4.	To plan find the optimal path using path finding algorithms for planning the path to ensure all the terrain is explored.
5.	To develop XR visualization capabilities within Unreal Engine to display the real-time 3D terrain models.
