#Domain: Extended Reality
#Problem Statement:
The training operations of the Air Force pose significant financial challenges, primarily 
due to the high cost of fuel required for aircraft operations. Ensuring the highest standards of 
training for personnel is paramount, especially considering the substantial investment in 
aircraft and the considerable portion of funds allocated to fuel expenses. To address these 
challenges, we propose the implementation of a mixed reality system designed specifically for 
airmen training. This mixed reality system will offer immersive training experiences without 
the need for actual aircraft flights, thereby eliminating fuel costs and reducing wear and tear on 
aircraft. By leveraging state-of-the-art technology, such as virtual reality and augmented 
reality, airmen will be able to engage in realistic simulations of flight maneuvers and navigation 
through various terrains.
